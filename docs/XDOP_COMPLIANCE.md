# XdoP Compliance Guidelines

## Overview

The Cross-Domain Operational Protocol (XdoP) ensures that PodX operates within safe and efficient parameters across all 7 operational domains.

## The 7 XdoP Domains

1. **Temporal Coherence**: Ensuring causality is maintained.
2. **Spatial Integrity**: Boundary enforcement.
3. **Energy Conservation**: Efficiency metrics.
4. **Information Fidelity**: Lossless data transmission.
5. **Security & Privacy**: Access control and encryption.
6. **Scalability**: Load balancing and resource management.
7. **Interoperability**: Standardized API contracts.

## Compliance Checklist

- [ ] All modules must implement `IXdoPCompliant` interface.
- [ ] Latency must not exceed 50ms per hop.
- [ ] Redundancy level must be at least N+1.
